# Train Tickets

Problem: Implement an algorithm for allocating seats for train passengers. Each coach has a number of compartments; each compartment has a fixed number of seats.

A person buying multiple seats (for their family, or for a group of friends etc.) should have them in the same compartment or in as few compartments as possible.
